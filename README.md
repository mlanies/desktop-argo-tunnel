## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Cloudflared**: The application requires `cloudflared` binary to be installed
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install cloudflared
  
  # Windows
  winget install Cloudflare.cloudflared
  
  # Linux
  wget -q https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
  sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
  ```

### Download & Install

1. Download the latest release for your platform from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Install the application:
   - **macOS**: Open the `.dmg` file and drag to Applications
   - **Windows**: Run the `.exe` installer
   - **Linux**: Install the `.deb` or `.AppImage` package

## Quick Start

1. **Launch the Application**
   - The dashboard will show your current infrastructure status

2. **Add Your First Server**
   - Click "Add Server" in the sidebar
   - Enter server details (name, host, port, protocol)
   - Save credentials if needed

3. **Connect to a Service**
   - Navigate to the "Servers" tab
   - Select a server from the list
   - Choose a service (SSH, RDP, or TCP)
   - Click "Connect"
   - The application will:
     - Automatically assign a random local port (10000-60000)
     - Start a `cloudflared access tcp` tunnel
     - Display the local port in the service details

4. **View Active Connections**
   - Navigate to "Active Connections" tab
   - See all running tunnels with their local ports and PIDs
   - Stop tunnels when no longer needed

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Frontend**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- TanStack Router for routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- i18next for internationalization

**Backend**
- Rust with Tauri 2.0
- Native OS integration
- Secure IPC communication
- Process management for `cloudflared`

**Core Integration**
- `cloudflared` binary for tunnel operations
- Native SSH/RDP client integration
- Secure credential storage using OS keychain

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Rust 1.70+
- Tauri CLI

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd desktop-argo-tunnel

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm tauri build
```

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start Vite dev server
- `pnpm build` - Build frontend
- `pnpm tauri dev` - Run Tauri in development mode
- `pnpm tauri build` - Build production application

## Configuration

The application stores configuration in:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.desktop-argo-tunnel`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\desktop-argo-tunnel`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/desktop-argo-tunnel`

### Settings

Access settings via the Settings tab to configure:
- Language preference
- Cloudflared binary path
- Default tunnel configurations
- Connection timeouts
- Log levels

## Cloudflared Integration

This application provides a GUI for the following `cloudflared` commands:

| CLI Command | GUI Equivalent |
|-------------|----------------|
| `cloudflared access ssh` | Connect to SSH Service |
| `cloudflared access rdp` | Connect to RDP Service |
| `cloudflared access tcp` | Connect to TCP Service |

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
- Ensure `cloudflared` is installed and in PATH
- Check application logs in the config directory

### Tunnel creation fails
- Verify Cloudflare account credentials
- Check internet connectivity
- Review tunnel logs in the Logs tab

### Connection issues
- Verify server host and port are correct
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure `cloudflared` has necessary permissions

## Planned Features
- **Native RDP Integration**: Automatically launch `mstsc` (Remote Desktop Connection) with the target host pre-configured upon connection.
- **Native SSH Integration**: Automatically launch `putty` with the target host pre-configured for SSH connections.
- **Credential Management**: Securely save and auto-fill login credentials (username, password, domain) for both `mstsc` and `putty` sessions.
